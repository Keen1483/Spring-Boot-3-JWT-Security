# Spring-Boot-3-JWT-Security
Spring Security, Oauth2 Resource Server, JWT with SecurityFilterChain class

Make sure you have MySQL installed on your computer.

This project is an update of Spring-Boot-2-JWT-Security project from Spring Boot 2.7.6 to 3.0.3.
I have removed WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class and I have used SecurityFilterChain class and
custom Dsl to perform security
